## Simple Instruction Level Debugger:
In this homework, we are going to implement a simple instruction-level debugger that allows a user to debug a program interactively at the assembly instruction level. You can implement the debugger by using the ptrace interface. The commands you have to implement are summarized as follows:

## Implemented commands:
All of the commands required by the homework are completed, listing as below: 

 - [x] break {instruction-address}: add a break point
 - [x] cont: continue execution
 - [x] delete {break-point-id}: remove a break point
 - [x] disasm addr: disassemble instructions in a file or a memory region
 - [x] dump addr [length]: dump memory content
 - [x] exit: terminate the debugger
 - [x] get reg: get a single value from a register
 - [x] getregs: show registers
 - [x] help: show this message
 - [x] list: list break points
 - [x] load {path/to/a/program}: load a pã„Ÿrogram
 - [x] run: run the program
 - [x] vmmap: show memory layout
 - [x] set reg val: get a single value to a register
 - [x] si: step into instruction
 - [x] start: start the program and stop at the first instruction
 
## Notes:
 - When a dump contains an address where a breakpoint is hit, one would notify that the memory content at the address is not software interrupt 3 (0xcc in byte stream). The reason is that we have to revert to the original so that restarting from any break point will execute the right code. This is not included in the spec so we define it here.
 - Setting breakpoint outside of the code region is possible but undefined across multiple runs for a shared-object type ELF executable since we could only recognize the base address of .text section of that object itself.
 - Setting a breakpoint takes no effect if there exists an enabled breakpoint at the same address already.
 - When a breakpoint is disabled by `sdb`, one could re-enable it by setting a breakpoint at the same address. However, if the initial activation of that breakpoint fails, `sdb` will disable it automatically.
 - Except for `SIGSEGV`, `SIGSTOP`, `SIGTSTP`, and `SIGTRAP`, all delivered signals targeting the child process will be sent upon the next restarting-type commands (`si`, `c`, `r`).
